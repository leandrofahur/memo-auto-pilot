[10:00 AM] Alex:
Alright, letâ€™s get started. Thanks everyone for joining. Todayâ€™s goal is to align on our Q3 product strategy and finalize the roadmap.

[10:01 AM] Jordan:
Sounds good. Iâ€™ll kick off with engineering. Weâ€™ve completed 80% of the API overhaul. Weâ€™re still on track to finish the final integration tests by July 25.

[10:03 AM] Priya:
Thatâ€™s great. From the design side, weâ€™ve wrapped up the mockups for the new onboarding flow. Iâ€™ll share the Figma link in Slack after the meeting.

[10:04 AM] Alex:
Awesome. Letâ€™s make sure we schedule a usability test round for those new flows next week.

[10:05 AM] Sam:
On the marketing front, weâ€™re prepping the landing page revamp. Weâ€™re aiming to A/B test copy for three positioning angles. Weâ€™ll need early access to the final onboarding flow by August 1.

[10:07 AM] Jordan:
Noted. We can expose a feature flag by then so marketing can test without waiting for the full release.

[10:08 AM] Alex:
Perfect. Letâ€™s also remember to sync with customer success on any changes that could impact onboarding metrics. Anything else?

[10:09 AM] Priya:
One quick thing â€” can we consider adding a progress bar during onboarding? Some test users said they felt a bit lost without one.

[10:10 AM] Alex:
Good idea. Jordan, can you estimate the effort for that?

[10:11 AM] Jordan:
Probably half a day to a day of work. We can slot that in if it's prioritized.

[10:12 AM] Alex:
Letâ€™s do it. Better onboarding is a big bet for Q3.
